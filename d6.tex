\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Identification}

This is the design document and test plan for the internship management system
being developed by Team W for the Professional Software Engineering 3 course.
The internship management system is for Software Engineering (SE) and Electronic
and Software Engineering (ESE) students, studying in the school of Computing
Science.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Diagram}

\begin{centering}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{PSDDiagram.pdf}
\end{centering}

\subsection{Rationale}

We decided upon this system architecture as any component of the system should 
have the properties of being interchangeable with another substitutable 
component (substitutable defined as being having the same API). For this reason, 
we grouped related functionalities together and made them into a component. 
The `Ad Manager' and the `Databases' components could be combined together 
into one large `Database' component, but we did not want to create a coupling 
between these components - the `Ad Manager' may well have a database inside 
it, but the information inside this database is managed in a different way from 
the other data in the system such as users and companies.

All other components are defined by the primary reason that any component in the 
system can be replaced with no effect to the overall working of the system.

The `Session' component is essentially acting as a broker to user requests. This
simplifies the user interface's access to the functionality of the system and
further aids the ability for components to be swapped out with others as only
one component, the `Session' may have to be modified.

\section{State Charts}

\subsection{Advertisement}

\subsubsection{Diagram}

\includegraphics{advertState.png}

\subsubsection{Rationale}

The form of the state chart was decided based on the simplistic nature of an 
advertisements status. All adverts start off life as pending, after a company
has made the initial submission - however this is outside the scope of
the current system as it is not a ``must have'' use case. They can be
revised at any time prior to either being declined by the course
coordinator, where they are removed from the system and feedback sent
to the company(outside the scope) or published for viewing.

\subsection{Student}

\subsubsection{Diagram}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{studentState.png}

\subsubsection{Rationale}

We decided to create a state chart for a Student's flow through the
system as to clarify the functionality of the system with relation to
the student, and also for a base reason of a student having a
different state at multiple points in the system. There is one main
state that a student can take through this system to result in the
final state, this is modelling the best case scenario for a student
where a student will eventually end up with an approved final
placement, which we have interpreted as being one of the main
functionalities of the system. 

A student continually changes state between `Idle' and `Pending
Acceptance' (through either `Applied for Position' or `Found Self
Sourced Role') potentially multiple times until a suitable position
has been found and only then they will progress on to `Offer
Approved' which is the final resting state of this entity.

Each of the 3 available user types will be able to interact with this interface
but if the user has course coordinator rights then all available adverts can be
manipulated (published, denied etc), if they have registered employer rights
they'll be able to create/append and submit adverts for review and if they are
of type student, they'll only be able to view all published adverts.
