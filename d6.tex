\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Identification}

This is the design document and test plan for the internship management system
being developed by Team W for the Professional Software Engineering 3 course.
The internship management system is for Software Engineering (SE) and Electronic
and Software Engineering (ESE) students, studying in the school of Computing
Science.

\subsection{Purpose and Description Of Document}

This document serves as the design document containing the overall system
architecture diagram with associated state charts. Each component in the
system architecture also has its own class diagrams and API specifications
specified.

\subsection{Document Status and Schedule}

This document is the draft version of the deliverable and is subject to major
change.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Diagram}

\begin{centering}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,angle=270]{PSDDiagram.pdf}
\end{centering}

\subsection{Rationale}

We decided upon this system architecture as any component of the system should 
have the properties of being interchangeable with another substitutable 
component (substitutable defined as being having the same API). For this reason, 
we grouped related functionalities together and made them into a component. 
The `Ad Manager' and the `Databases' components could be combined together 
into one large `Database' component, but we did not want to create a coupling 
between these components - the `Ad Manager' may well have a database inside 
it, but the information inside this database is managed in a different way from 
the other data in the system such as users and companies.

All other components are defined by the primary reason that any component in the 
system can be replaced with no effect to the overall working of the system.

The `Session' component is essentially acting as a broker to user requests. This
simplifies the user interface's access to the functionality of the system and
further aids the ability for components to be swapped out with others as only
one component, the `Session' may have to be modified.

\newpage

\section{State Charts}

\subsection{Advertisement}

\subsubsection{Diagram}

\includegraphics{advertState.png}

\subsubsection{Rationale}

The form of the state chart was decided based on the simplistic nature of an 
advertisements status. All adverts start off life as pending, after a company
has made the initial submission. They can be revised at any time prior to either
being declined by the course coordinator, where they are removed from the system
(and feedback sent to the company) or published for viewing.

An addition (which requires clarification) is the `Position Filled' state and
associated end state. This is asked in the questions section at the end of the
document. The question is number \ref{itm:advertDestroy}. As such, that part of 
the diagram is under review pending further information.

\subsection{Student}

\subsubsection{Diagram}

\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{studentState.png}

\subsubsection{Rationale}

We decided to create a state chart for a Student's flow through the
system as to clarify the functionality of the system with relation to
the student, and also for a base reason of a student having a
different state at multiple points in the system. There are various
paths that a student can take through this system and ultimately
result in the same final state, this is modelling the best case
scenario for a student where a student will eventually end up with an
approved final placement, which we have interpreted as being one of
the main functionalities of the system. 

A student continually changes state between `Idle' and `Pending
Acceptance' (through either `Applied for Position' or `Found Self
Sourced Role') potentially multiple times until a suitable position
has been found and only then they will progress on to `Offer
Approved'. A Student will then be stagnant until a visit has been
undertaken and then the student will terminate. A visit is outside the
control of the Student, so it will stay in this state until changed by
an outside element.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{Employers are required to register however during the registration process
only the company name and email is supplied (registerNewEmployer()). However,
users are required to supply their username and password to login. Based on the
assumption that the employer/company name is the username, what would the
password initially be set to?}

\item{How does the course coordinator decline an offer a student has received?}

\item{\label{itm:advertDestroy} When and how does an approved/published 
advertisement disappear from the set of available advertisements?}
